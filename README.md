The motherboard key components are the processor and processor socket, memory or RAM slots.
he Processor also known as CPU or Microprocessor executes instructions, performs calculations, and coordinates input/output operations kind of like the motherboardâ€™s brain. 
The  processor also improves the speed of the computer allowing it to complete its tasks at a faster rate.  
  This speed is measured in gigahertz and hertz  which is the amount of cycles per second. 
  One hertz equals one cycle per second and One gigahertz equals one billion cycles per second.
  The number of bits a processor can register right now is between register sizes of 64 or 128 bits. 
  In order for the processor to transmit data to the rest of the board it uses electrical lines also known as buses to transport not only to the rest of the board but to other systems as well. 

The processor has a special unit called an arithmetic logic unit, which does calculations based on the needs of the computer.
 It also coordinates activity within the processor.  
 Pipelines which are  separate internal buses that operate simultaneously are kind of like an assembly line.
 The add it benefit of these pipelines is increasing clock speeds which controls the transfer of 10s and 0s. 
 Another important factor is cache memory which is a very fast type of memory designed to increase the speed of processor operations.
